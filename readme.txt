TARGET: Some elements to be placed over the background image/video such that these will seems fixed with the background while the background is Object-Fit: Cover. That means, the elements will scale up/down alongwith the background with keeping its respective position fixed wrt the background. This will give the viewer an impression that, the elements are parts of the background image. This is required, when we want to make one element interactive while fixing the position and size along with the background.

Here, we have crated two different group of elements, ABC & XYZ stored into separate group to perform some tasks. The background has been considered as image, but could be a video.

Concept: Creating a Overlay, contains all the elements, is of exact size of BG and scale/up or down along with BG. The overlay is center aligned. All the element position and scale are relative to the Overlay.

Location and scale of each elements to be set as required. If common css to be used, the element's position to be put in HTML.

Some modification might be required case to case basis.
